Dank meme bot for Chatango using ch.py

## How to Make Bot

We are using an updated version of ch.py: [TheClonerx/ch.py](https://github.com/TheClonerx/ch.py)

Even this version of ch.py has a crucial flaw which we have fixed using [a dank hack](https://github.com/LmaoLover/LmaoBot/commit/c3a5aa8a9dfe120f2320cbcec4a1cc6a6118ccb1).  There will be no PRs for this fix as it does not integrate with the useless features of ch.py.  We only care that `onMessage` is properly called for every message.  If your bot sometimes does not recognize a message it is probably due to this flaw and you should apply the hack.
